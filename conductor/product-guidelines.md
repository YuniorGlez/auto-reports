# Product Guidelines

These guidelines define the standards for the automated reports generated by SQUAADS Aura-Scope, ensuring they are valuable, consistent, and context-aware.

## 1. Multi-Perspective Reporting
Aura-Scope MUST generate four distinct reports for every Pull Request, each with a tailored tone and focus:

1.  **Client Report (Financial Stakeholder)**:
    - **Tone**: Professional, strategic, and ROI-oriented.
    - **Focus**: High-level business value, project progress relative to budget/timeline, and strategic milestones.
    - **Constraint**: Minimize technical jargon; translate features into business outcomes.

2.  **Product Manager Report**:
    - **Tone**: Tactical, analytical, and objective.
    - **Focus**: Operational impact, velocity, scope changes, and technical debt implications.
    - **Constraint**: Highlight risks and deviations from the roadmap.

3.  **Developer Report (Internal Team)**:
    - **Tone**: Direct, technical, and precise.
    - **Focus**: Key architectural changes, critical diff highlights, and technical complexity.
    - **Constraint**: Focus on "how" and "where" the logic changed.

4.  **End-User Report (Release Notes)**:
    - **Tone**: Benefit-driven, friendly, and accessible.
    - **Focus**: New features, bug fixes, and improvements that affect the user experience.
    - **Constraint**: Use clear language; focus on "what's new for me."

## 2. Adaptive Visual Identity
- **Dynamic Branding**: The HTML templates MUST inherit the visual identity of the host project.
- **Brand Mapping**: The system should allow configuration of primary colors, secondary colors, and logos at the project level to ensure reports feel like a native part of the project's ecosystem.
- **Structural Consistency**: While colors and logos change, the layout skeleton (header, summary section, detail list, footer) must remain consistent to ensure cross-project familiarity.

## 3. Evidence-Based Content
- **Diff Grounding**: All summaries and value claims MUST be grounded in the actual code changes (diffs) and commit messages.
- **Context Prioritization**: The PR description is the primary source of truth for "intent," while the diff is the source of truth for "implementation."
- **Fallback Logic**: If a PR description is empty, the LLM must synthesize the report solely from the git diff and commit history.
